# ∀nswerify

Because Я is always better than R!

Inspired by [Cornify](https://github.com/Cornify/Cornify). Idea originally dropped by [Scott Tolinski](https://github.com/stolinski) in the [Syntax podcast](https://syntax.fm/show/324/typescript-fundamentals).

# How to ∀nswerify

To add the ∀nswerify script to your website, include this script tag in your HTML:
~~~html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/miiimooomiii/answerify/answerify.js"></script>
~~~

Then you can ∀nswerify at will with the following Javascript code:

`answerify();`

For example, to add a ∀nswerify button you can do:

~~~html
<button onclick="answerify();">∀nswerify me!</button>
~~~
