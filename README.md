# KoЯnify

Because Я is always better than R!

Inspired by [Cornify](https://github.com/Cornify/Cornify). Idea originally dropped by [Scott Tolinski](https://github.com/stolinski) in the [Syntax podcast](https://syntax.fm/show/324/typescript-fundamentals).

# Installing the KoЯnify script

To add the KoЯnify script to your website, include this script tag in your HTML:
~~~html
<script  type="text/javascript"  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dvdhllbrg/kornify/kornify.js"></script>
~~~

# Using it
Then you can KoЯnify at will with the following Javascript code:

`kornify();`

For example, to add a KoЯnify button you can do:

~~~html
<button  href="#"  onclick="kornify();">KoЯnify m!</button>
~~~
